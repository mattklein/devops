NEXT: start with the ops registry?
 - obtain the AMIs that exist in our account
 - have some methods on the AMI: create instance

What will the flow be, now that I've got an AMI?
When we pull off AMIs from the ops-registry, do we return them as DEVOPS
    objects, rather than Boto objects?
I think so (but they'll wrap the Boto objects)

What does returning them as devops objects get us?
The ability to write my own methods on them
E.g., activate/deactivate
